	          <p>I recently graduated from City, University of London with a Class I in BSc Psychology. While I was completing my university degree, I started dabbling with HTML and CSS when I could find the time - unfortunately, as I was working 25-60% while studying full-time, I couldn't dedicate as much time to it as I would've liked, but I completed online tutorials through Codecademy and codebar and attended workshops when I could.</br></br>It wasn't until the beginning of this autumn, after I'd finished my degree and my current job was coming to an end, that I realised that I now had the chance to seriously pursue a career as a web developer. So, during the past two months I have brushed up on my HTML and CSS skills, and during the past month I have given myself a crash course in JavaScript and worked on meeting the prerequisites for the Founders and Coders course in London.</br></br>I love programming and the fact that it gives me the ability to create things, and be creative and use logic to solve challenging problems — not to mention that there’s always more to learn! It’s something that I get a lot of energy from, and it would be amazing to have it as a career!</br></br>My experiences of the community here in London and the one surrounding Founders and Coders has been great, it’s such an encouraging and helpful community, and it’s just one more thing that makes me excited about making a move into this industry. I have had so much use of workshops and networking events organised by organisations within the community (see the Community section to find out more about these organisations) and I would love to become more involved with organisations like these once I have aquired the necessary programming skills.</p>

We bought a one-way plane ticket, booked a hostel for two weeks, and started looking for jobs and a flat once we got there, and within five days, I had found a job and a flat.</p></div>
